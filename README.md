# Calculator
Created a simple calculator using HTML, CSS and JavaScript.

#### Updates
- Updated UI
- Fixed an issue where dividing by 0.0, 0.00 etc, caused the app to crash.
- Added keyboard support.  Most buttons on the calculator have been mapped to their equivalent keys, with the following exceptions:
    - **c** is mapped to **Esc**
    - **+/-** is mapped to **n**
    - **=** is mapped to both **=** and **Enter**
